SparseMas
=========

Sparse matrix storage that supports no-overhead expansion, and iteration over filled elements.

Depends on the GNU Trove libraries (or some other low-overhead long-to-object mapping).

This is but the core, to convey the idea; further development may or may not happen in public (but please let me
know if it is being used & would benefit from it).
